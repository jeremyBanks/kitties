# KittyTree

This simple page displays the ancestry of your kittys. It does so by querying
the CryptoKitty-API and loading all the kittys' data, displaying it in a nice
[Treant](http://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/) visualization.

Be warned, if you query for higher generation kittys there will be a lot of data
loaded wich could potentially get you blocked by the CryptoKitty server and it
could crash your browser(tab) because of the amount of cute kittys.
